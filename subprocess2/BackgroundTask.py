        BackgroundTaskInfo - Represents a task that was sent to run in the background. Will be updated as the status of that process changes.

            Can be used like an object or a dictionary.

        This object populates its data automatically as the program runs in the background, managed by a thread.

        FIELDS:

            stdoutData - Bytes read automatically from stdout, if stdout was a pipe, or from stderr if stderr was set to subprocess.STDOUT
            stderrData - Bytes read automatically from stderr, if different pipe than stdout.
            isFinished - False while the background application is running, True when it completes.
            returnCode - None if the program has not completed, otherwise the numeric return code.
            timeElapsed - Float of how many seconds have elapsed since the last update (updates happen very close to the "pollInterval" provided when calling runInBackground)
